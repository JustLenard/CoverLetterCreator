Dear Hiring Team at EveryMatrix,

I am a self-taught developer with approximately 3 years of coding experience. I am writing to express my immense interest in the Frontend Developer position at your company, EveryMatrix. My unique blend of development skills, adaptability, and resilience, along with my desire to be a part of a groundbreaking organization, make me a strong contender for this role.

At Tara Interactive, I actively contributed to two React projects, one of which I then solo-ported to React Native. Additionally, I was an integral part of a 3 man team that developed a complex surveillance application with microservices, real-time surveillance features, and more. I took the initiative in project ownership, coding new features, and resolving issues. I also played a role in deploying codes across multiple environments and ensuring code quality and maintainability through constructive code reviews.

One of my proudest achievements is the building of Chatify, a real-time chat application featuring group and one-on-one chat, CRUD operations, real-time notifications, and integration with OpenAI's gpt-3.5 model. The project was a testament to my ability to utilize modern technologies and frameworks effectively, a skill that directly aligns with the requirements of your job description.

I am quite familiar with the technologies you use - React, Redux, WebPack, NodeJS, and working with HTTP2 and WebSockets APIs, as well as deploying containerized apps via Docker, Kubernetes, and continuous delivery pipelines. I can confidently say that my experiences have prepared me well enough to make significant contributions to the EMFE department.


Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. 

Sincerely,
Cociug Vitalie
