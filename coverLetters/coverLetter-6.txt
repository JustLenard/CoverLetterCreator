Dear Hiring Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Cociug Vitalie, a self-taught developer with approximately 3 years of coding experience. I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Full Stack Developer position at your esteemed company. My robust development skills, adaptability, passion for improvement, and hands-on experience make me an excellent fit for this role.

In my recent role at Tara Interactive, I was a key contributor to various React projects and even had the opportunity to port one of them to React Native independently. I was also part of a team that developed a complex surveillance application involving micro frontends, microservices, multitenancy, websockets, and real-time surveillance features. This experience allowed me to develop a profound understanding of Full Stack development, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and tooling which align perfectly with the requirements of your role.

A project I am particularly proud of is Chatify, a real-time chat application I designed and developed. Using technologies such as React, TypeScript, Redux and Socket.IO, I crafted a responsive application capable of group chats, one-on-one chats, CRUD operations, and real-time notifications. This project showcased my ability to innovate, implement, and troubleshoot, qualities that I believe to be vital for a Full Stack Developer.

When it comes to the technical requirements of your role, I am well-versed in AWS Lambda, TypeScript, and React, coupled with a solid foundation in automated testing, Agile, and CI/CD. Moreover, my hands-on experience with deploying and managing containerized apps using Docker, plus my familiarity with Linux are all valuable assets that I bring to the table.

What attracts me to this role is not just the opportunity to work with modern web technologies, but also the company's dedication to innovation and delivering unmatched solutions. I am eager to contribute to a team that values continuous improvement, quality-focused development, and maintains a product mindset. 

In conclusion, I am excited about the prospect of contributing to your esteemed organization and adding value to the team. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my application.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Cociug Vitalie
