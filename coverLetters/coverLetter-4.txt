Dear Hiring Team at EveryMatrix,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Cociug Vitalie, a passionate developer with under 2 years of hands-on experience in building scalable and efficient technology solutions. I am writing to express my immense interest in the Frontend Developer position at your company, EveryMatrix. My unique blend of development skills, adaptability, and resilience, along with my desire to be a part of a groundbreaking organization, make me a strong contender for this role.

At Tara Interactive, I actively contributed to two React projects, one of which I then solo-ported to React Native. Additionally, I was an integral part of a 3 man team that developed a complex surveillance application with microservices, real-time surveillance features, and more. I took the initiative in project ownership, coding new features, and resolving issues. I also played a role in deploying codes across multiple environments and ensuring code quality and maintainability through constructive code reviews.

One of my proudest achievements is the building of Chatify, a real-time chat application featuring group and one-on-one chat, CRUD operations, real-time notifications, and integration with OpenAI's gpt-3.5 model. The project was a testament to my ability to utilize modern technologies and frameworks effectively, a skill that directly aligns with the requirements of your job description.

I am quite familiar with the technologies you use - React, Redux, WebPack, NodeJS, and working with HTTP2 and WebSockets APIs, as well as deploying containerized apps via Docker, Kubernetes, and continuous delivery pipelines. I can confidently say that my experiences have prepared me well enough to make significant contributions to the EMFE department.

Working at EveryMatrix is particularly appealing to me because of the company's emphasis on staying on the bleeding edge of technology. I am inspired by your commitment to delivering top-notch iGaming software, content, and services. The prospect of contributing to your mission and growing alongside an extraordinary team is an opportunity I deeply yearn for.

In conclusion, I am eager not just to work with modern web technologies, but also to contribute towards making EveryMatrix the best B2B iGaming provider in the world. I truly believe that I can add value to your team and your mission. I look forward to an opportunity to further discuss my application and showcase how my skills and experiences align with your needs.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. 

Sincerely,
Cociug Vitalie
