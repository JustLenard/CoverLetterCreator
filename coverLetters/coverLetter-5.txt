Dear Hiring Team at Fortec,

I trust this letter finds you in good spirits. My name is Cociug Vitalie and I am an industrious, self-taught developer with 1.5 of direct development experience but with the added advantage of high adaptability and resilience. I came across your posting for a Frontend Developer and believe I am an excellent fit given my skills, experience and passion for software development.

During my tenure at Tara Interactive, I played a pivotal role in two React projects, and even proudly took on the task of solo-porting one of them to React Native. My responsibilities spanned across the software development lifecycle, going beyond coding to include troubleshooting, conducting analyses and deploying code across various environments.

A project that stands as testament to my abilities is Chatify, a real-time chat application. This project is a culmination of using modern technologies and frameworks, including but not limited to React, Redux Toolkit, Axios and the OpenAI API, to deliver a seamless chatting experience.

What sets me apart is my ability to mesh my theoretical knowledge with practical applications. I am familiar with the technologies listed in your job description, including TypeScript, React and Node, among others. I also possess hands-on experience with SQL databases, adherence to the OOP, SOLID, and design principles, and an understanding of infrastructure as code.

The chance to work at Fortech is immensely appealing due to your emphasis on empowerment, teamwork, and continuous self-development. Your commitment to crafting quality software across a broad range of industries aligns with my career aspirations and I am excited at the prospect of being a part of your mission to create outstanding software solutions.

In conclusion, I am thrilled about the opportunity to apply and further develop my skills at Fortech. I am eager to contribute to your mission and potentially become a part of your esteemed team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further and illustrate how my skills can serve your needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Cociug Vitalie
