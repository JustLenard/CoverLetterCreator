Dear Hiring Team at K&C,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am a self-taught developer and I am thrilled to apply for the frontend developer role in your organization. With my targeted experience in React.js and Redux , I am sure I can continue developing your enterprise platform efficiently.

While working at Tara Interactive, I deployed my expertise in React and Redux within a highly collaborative setting, driving the development of several complex applications. A primary example is a surveillance application featuring micro frontends, real-time surveillance and microservices. This work demonstrably reflects my capabilities in navigating large-scale projects and optimizing Redux utility.

Apart from my involvement in Tara Interactive, I have personally built 'Chatify', a real-time chat application demonstrating my skill as a full stack developer. The app integrates multiple features such as global chat, one on one messaging, real-time notifications and much more. You can review the live demo at https://chatify-app.up.railway.app/login.

In terms of tech-stack, I am proficient with React, Redux Toolkit, Node.js, NestJS, TypeScript and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I am comfortable with deploying applications to staging and production enviroments, while also having experience with Jest for testing purposes.

Upon examining the requirements for your role, I see a close alignment with my skills and abilities. I pride myself on my quick learning, logical-analytical thought process and goal-oriented mindset. I am also keen on learning innovative technologies.

Joining an international team like K&C intrigues me. The chance to grow both personally and technically, while contributing my expertise to your projects is an opportunity that excites me.
